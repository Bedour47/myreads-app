# MyReads Project

This project is created for [React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) @ Udacity


## Overview

MyReads is a book tracking app built with `React JS` that allows the user to categorize the books in three shelves [Currently Reading, Want To Read, Read], where the user can change the category and shift the book to another shelf or even remove it from all shelves. Also,  the user can search for a book and add it to any of their shelves.


## Installation

To run the project on your local machine:

* Download or Clone this repository
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API is provide by Udacity. So, it uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
